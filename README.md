This is a simple task management desktop app built with Python.

It uses:
- gspread to connect and read tasks from a Google Sheet
- plyer to show desktop notifications for new tasks
- tkinter to create a basic user interface

When you click "Refresh Tasks", it checks the Google Sheet for any new tasks.
If new tasks are found, they are displayed in the app and a notification is shown.
